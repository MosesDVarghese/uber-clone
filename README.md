# Social Media App with Expo Go and Supabase

Yuber is a ride-booking application that provides a seamless and secure user experience. The app features full user authentication and sign-in with Google, powered by Clerk, ensuring a streamlined registration and login process. User data is securely stored on Neon, a serverless Postgres platform. Yuber's main screens include a ride history view, a user profile section, and a booking interface. To book a ride, users select their start locationâ€”defaulting to their current locationâ€”and choose a destination. Yuber then suggests nearby drivers, providing detailed information such as pricing, distance, fees, and available car seats. Payment for rides is conveniently handled through Stripe, allowing users to enter their payment details and confirm their ride with ease. Once payment is complete, users are ready to embark on their journey.

Tools Used: React Native, Expo Go, Clerk, Neon, Stripe, Geoapify, TailWindCSS

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
